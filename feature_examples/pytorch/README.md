# Code Examples for PyTorch

This directory contains code examples showing how to use PyTorch with Graphcore's IPUs. These include full models as well as examples of how to use pre-trained models.

## Complete examples of models

- [Octave Convolutions](octconv) are a novel convolutional layer in neural networks. This example shows an implementation of how to train the model and run it for inference.
