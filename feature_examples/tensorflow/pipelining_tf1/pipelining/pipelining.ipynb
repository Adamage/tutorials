    "### Pipeline Execution Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the key phases of pipeline execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ramp up -  the pipeline is being filled; work is flowing into each stage \n",
    "until all stages are filled (all IPUs are busy).\n",
    "2. Main execution - all stages are filled and IPU utilisation is maximised.\n",
    "3. Ramp down - the pipeline is being drained; work is flowing out of each stage \n",
    "until all stages are empty (no IPUs are busy).\n",
    "4. Weight updates - all pipeline batches have been processed, so accumulated \n",
    "gradients can be processed (gradient descent) and weights updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Each individual batch passed through the pipeline is called a **mini-batch**.  \n",
    "* Weights are updated only once a set of mini-batches has been fully processed.  \n",
    "* Gradients are accumulated across a set of mini-batches.  \n",
    "* Weight updates are applied once all the complete set of mini-batches are processed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, pipelining enforces **gradient accumulation** where:  \n",
    "\n",
    "`effective batch size` = `mini-batch size` * `gradient accumulation count`  \n",
    "\n",
    "Performing gradient accumulation is valid because summing the gradients across \n",
    "all the examples in a batch immediately and accumulating them over several steps are equivalent.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Increasing the gradient accumulation count has these benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A smaller proportion of time is spent in the ramp up and ramp down - that is, \n",
    "more time is spent in the main execution phase where maximum utilisation of the \n",
    "IPUs is made.\n",
    "2. Fewer overall weight updates are made, which saves compute time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the pipeline outline extended to show the progress of 16 mini-batches \n",
    "followed by a weight update. Notice that the best utilization of the IPUs is \n",
    "during the main phase and that this is sustained until the last mini-batch enters \n",
    "the pipeline, following which the ramp down begins. Also notice that weight \n",
    "updates are only applied once, following the ramp down (after the pipeline has \n",
    "been drained of all mini-batches.)\n",

    "  as an input in the first pipeline stage.\n",
    "* `outfeed_queue`: IPUOutfeedQueue, required if the last computational stage\n",
