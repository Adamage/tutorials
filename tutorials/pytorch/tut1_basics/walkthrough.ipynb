    "## What is PopTorch?\n",
    "PopTorch is a set of extensions for PyTorch to enable\n",
    "PyTorch models to run on Graphcore's IPU hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "PopTorch supports both inference and training. To run a\n",
    "model on the IPU you wrap your existing PyTorch model in\n",
    "either a PopTorch inference wrapper or a PopTorch training\n",
    "wrapper. You can provide further annotations to partition\n",
    "the model across multiple IPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can wrap individual layers in an IPU helper to\n",
    "designate which IPU they should go on. Using your\n",
    "annotations, PopTorch will use [PopART]\n",
    "(https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/popart-user-guide)\n",
    "to parallelise the model over the given number of IPUs.\n",
    "Additional parallelism can be expressed via a replication\n",
    "factor which enables you to data-parallelise the model over\n",
    "more IPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood PopTorch uses [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html),\n",
    "an intermediate representation (IR) of a PyTorch model,\n",
    "using the `torch.jit.# trace` API. That means it inherits\n",
    "the constraints of that API. These include:\n",
    "- Inputs must be Torch tensors or tuples/lists containing Torch tensors;\n",
    "- None can be used as a default value for a parameter but cannot be\n",
    "expliticly passed as an input value;\n",
    "- Hooks and `.grad` cannot be used to inspect weights and gradients;\n",
    "- `torch.jit.trace` cannot handle control flow or shape\n",
    "variations within the model. That is, the inputs passed at\n",
    "run-time cannot vary the control flow of the model or the\n",
    "shapes/sizes of results.\n",

    "To learn more about TorchScript and JIT, you can go through\n",
    "this [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html).\n",

    "PopTorch has been designed to require few manual\n",
    "alterations to your models in order to run them on IPU.\n",
